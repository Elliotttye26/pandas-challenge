## pandas-challenge
In this challenge we take district wide and school level information on standardized test scores to compare and contrast them in various ways to assist with drawing trends between budgets, types of school and the students themselves. In doing so, we may be able to strategize and make more informaed decisions within the schools and the district as a whole.

#Summary of the Analysis
Within the district a total of 8 charter and 7 district schools make up the total. District schools overall have more students and carry higher budgets than charter schools. Overall for both types of schools, reading scores are higher than math scores. Overall grades do not seem to be affected strongly by what grade the students are in, only what type of school they attend.

#Two Conclusions from the Calculations
1. As stated above charter schools have fewer students, but those students outperform the students of district schools in both reading and math with higher grades overall and a higher percentage of the student body passing the subject. this is most strongly reflected when looking at the top 5 perfomring schools which are all charter, against the lowest 5, which are all district. Howvever, this is negatively corelated to the budgets of the schools. District schools are receiving higher budgets but are not getting the return in the form of higher grades from the students.
2. The number of students in the school may be related to the overall grades. Charter schools having fewer students may be able to study and learn from teachers on a more personalized 1 on 1 basis. While district schools with higher student populations are not able to provide the same level of personalized classrooms and teachers.
