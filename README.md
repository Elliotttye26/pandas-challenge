## pandas-challenge
In this challenge we take district wide and school level information on standardized test scores to compare and contrast them in various ways to assist with drawing trends between budgets, types of school and the students themselves. In doing so, we may be able to strategize and make more informaed decisions within the schools and the district as a whole.

#Summary of the Analysis


#Two Conclusions from the Calculations


#citations used to assist with functions, errors and troubleshooting, and general python and pandas.
